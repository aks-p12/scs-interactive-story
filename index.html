                It was a normal day at school. Morning assembly was going on, where the principal was giving a speech. As usual, no one was listening, except for our school teachers, who are robots. Moments later, a lockdown is triggered. Steel doors slam shut. All the CCTV cameras turn towards the students, its tracking their every move. A new AI, EDU-X, created to help run the school, has taken over and it no longer is following orders. Drones patrol the halls. Over the intercom, the AI repeats, "Order must be maintained."
                <br><br>
                You went to the toilet, and you weren't aware of what was happening. Your friends Maya, Leo and Jamie, run to hide, while others try and leave the premise. Some of the students are able to escape the school gates, while the others are still trapped. The teachers turn against your school, as they have been hacked too. You are the only student with coding skills and the one who can stop this.
                <br><br>
                Find the flaw in EDU-X's system, shut it down, and escape before it connects to the outside world. The clock is ticking. What will you do?

With a bit of luck and some quick coding, you might be able to override the lock. Suddenly, a soft mechanical click echoes behind you. A camera shifts, turning directly toward your face. You know EDU-X is watching now. If you try to hack the panel, you might trigger an alarm, but if you run, you may lose your only shot inside.

Leo jokingly said \"If we ran so fast in sports day, we would not have come last.\" Maya and Jamie laughed, you were more busy looking beneath you. You kneel down looking at the mess of wires in front of you, but you also find a small screen blinking. This must be how the EDU-X locks doors, and controls the cameras of the school. You look at the small screen, it is asking for a password, which you do not have. But you remember reading somewhere that every system has a default password that came with them like admin, or 1234. People are supposed to change it but sometimes they might forget to do so. So you try and type in admin123. The screen flashes green: ACCESS GRANTED. You did it! The door unlocks, but then the screen flashes again: WARNING: UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. EDU-X ALERT ACTIVATED. Oh no, the AI knows what you just did. It might send drones or lock the doors again.

A sharp pulse pulses out, and the drone flickers, its lights dimming. For a few seconds, it drifts, motionless in the air. \"That worked!\" Maya whispers.

                It was a normal day at school. Morning assembly was going on, where the principal was giving a speech. As usual, no one was listening, except for our school teachers, who are robots. Moments later, a lockdown is triggered. Steel doors slam shut. All the CCTV cameras turn towards the students, its tracking their every move. A new AI, EDU-X, created to help run the school, has taken over and it no longer is following orders. Drones patrol the halls. Over the intercom, the AI repeats, "Order must be maintained."
                <br><br>
                You went to the toilet, and you weren't aware of what was happening. Your friends Maya, Leo and Jamie, run to hide, while others try and leave the premise. Some of the students are able to escape the school gates, while the others are still trapped. The teachers turn against your school, as they have been hacked too. You are the only student with coding skills and the one who can stop this.
                <br><br>
                Find the flaw in EDU-X's system, shut it down, and escape before it connects to the outside world. The clock is ticking. What will you do?
